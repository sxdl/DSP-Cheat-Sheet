# Transfer function classification based on phase characteristics

## Zero-phase transfer function(零相移传输函数)

$H(e^{j\omega})$ is nonnegative

## Linear phase transfer function(线性相位传输函数)

$$y[n] = x[n-D]$$

$$H(e^{j\omega}) = e^{-j\omega D}$$

## Minimum-phase and maximum-phase transfer function

### Minimum-phase transfer function

Causal stable system with all the zeros inside the unit circle.

### Maximum-phase transfer function

Causal stable system with all the zeros outside the unit circle.

### Mixed-phase transfer function

Causal stable system with zeros inside and outside the unit circle.
